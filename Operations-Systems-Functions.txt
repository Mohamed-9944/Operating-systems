Windows are an amazing operation system. It has many advantages and disadvantages as every operation system should have, because all operation systems are not perfect. which 
means they are going to have some defults or disadvantages in their program. I personally think Windows is amazing and helpful because it is easier for anyone to understand, 
and use. It also uses a lot of pictures to identify many different kinds of programs like games or apps. Windows also have better drive support in order to configure with 
other devices.
