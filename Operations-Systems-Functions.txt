Windows are an amazing operation system. It has many advantages and disadvantages as every operation system should have, because all operation systems are not perfect. which 
means they are going to have some defults or disadvantages in their program. I personally think Windows is amazing and helpful because it is easier for anyone to understand, 
and use. It also uses a lot of pictures to identify many different kinds of programs like games or apps. Windows also have better drive support in order to configure with 
other devices like i pads or phones.


Chrome OS are another operation system that I think are a very useful operation system. I have used this operation system personally during my middle school years, and they 
are good for using less battry when doing work other stuff. They also work as good offline as they do when online. The only thing I did not like about this particular 
operation system, is that it can't store information well like the other operation system. It does not have a big capasity to transfer multiple files at a time from one place to another.



when it comes to linux operation system, I think it is helpful, but at the same time I would not recomend it in curtain situations. The operation system is helpful in ways 
when you are trying to find a website or webpage that has no restriction, or you just trying to find a stable source in genral. Although when it comes to runing to trying to run your favorite program on the Linux operation system, it will not work.
